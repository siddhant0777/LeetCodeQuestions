============
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for(char cs : s.toCharArray()) c ^= cs;
        for(char ct : t.toCharArray()) c ^= ct;
        return c;
    }
}
================================

a ^ a = 0 (Any number XORed with itself results in 0).
a ^ 0 = a (Any number XORed with 0 results in the number itself).

Logic:

The idea is to XOR all characters in s and t.
Since XOR cancels out matching characters, only the extra character in t will remain.
Algorithm:

Initialize c to 0. This variable will store the result of XOR operations.
XOR all characters in string s with c.
XOR all characters in string t with c.
After processing both strings, c will hold the ASCII value of the extra character in t.
